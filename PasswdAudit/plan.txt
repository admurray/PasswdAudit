The basic point of this code is to effectively test for password policy
this means that 1 the password must not be of a certain chosen kind or
should not follow specific rules. For now, I will work on making sure
that they do not use the passwords from a specific text doc. 
The first requirement for that is, that I should be able to post a
single password to the application. I will begin with zencart.
I could have gone through the DB but I wish to accurately follow the steps
a person would use who has no access to the DB.

Another important thing that I would like to keep in mind is that I wouldn't
want to create a new connection for each attempt. It would be ideal to have
just one connection that keeps attempting.
